    <h1>Aerial Arts</h1>

    <h1>Getting Started!</h1>
        <p class="intro">Some people may think that aerial arts are daunting and difficult to begin doing. 
        While it may seem that way, the only way to get better is by practicing. The strength comes with continued training! Some of the notable aerial schools in 
        Portland, OR are <a href="https://nightflightaerial.com/">Night Flight Aerial</a>, <a href="http://awoldance.org">A-WOL Dance</a>, and <a href="https://www.thecircusproject.org/">The Circus Project.</a>
        </p>
    <h2>Apparatuses to Choose From</h2>  
        <p>Circus arts have a wide variety of disciplines, and aerial is no different. You can choose to train on whatever 
            apparatus suits your own aesthetic or comfort, to a certain extent.
